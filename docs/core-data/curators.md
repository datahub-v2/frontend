The Core Data Curators curate the [core data][].

Curation involves identifying and locating core (public) data, and packaging it up as high-quality [data packages][dp].

> **New team members wanted:** We are always seeking volunteers to join the Data Curators team. Get to be part of a crack team and develop and hone your data wrangling skills whilst helping to provide high quality data to the community.

* **Anyone can contribute**: details on the [roles and skills needed below](#roles).
* **Get involved**: read more below or jump straight to [the sign-up section](#sign-up).
* **[Data Curators Guide][guide]**: You can dive straight in and start packaging data by following the [core data curators guide][guide].

### What Roles and Skills are Needed

We have a variety of roles from identifying new "core" data, to collecting and packaging the data, to performing quality control.

**Core Skills** -- at least one of these skills is strongly recommended:

* **Data Wrangling Experience**. Many of our source data are not complex (just an Excel file or similar) and can be "wrangled" in a Spreadsheet program. What we therefore recommend is at least one of:
    * Experience with a Spreadsheet application such as Excel or (preferably) Google Docs including use of formulas and (desirably) macros (you should at least know how you could quickly convert a cell containing '2014' to '2014-01-01' across 1000 rows)
    * Coding for data processing (especially scraping) in one or more of python, javascript, bash
* **Data sleuthing** - the ability to dig up data on the web (specific desirable skills: you know how to search by filetype in google, you know where the developer tools are in chrome or firefox, you know how to find the URL a form posts to)

**Desirable Skills** (the more the better!):

* Data vs Metadata: know difference between data and metadata
* Familiarity with Git (and Github)
* Familiarity with a command line (preferably bash)
* Know what JSON is
* Mac or Unix is your default operating system (will make access to relevant tools that much easier)
* Knowledge of Web APIs and/or HTML
* Use of curl or similar command line tool for accessing Web APIs or web pages
* Scraping using a command line tool or (even better) by coding yourself
* Know what a Data Package and a Tabular Data Package are
* Know what a text editor is (e.g. notepad, textmate, vim, emacs, ...) and know how to use it (useful for both working with data and for editing Data Package metadata)
