title: Auto generated csv, json and zip
---

Here we describe what is auto generated for you: ZIP, CSV and JSON versions.

## ZIP

We auto generate compressed `ZIP` versions of datasets so users can download entire dataset with one click. Let's take a look at "finance-vix" dataset example - https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix :

Once downloaded you would get all available versions of the data along with the descriptor (metadata) file called "datapackage.json".

:::info
All datasets on DataHub are "packaged" as data packages (read more about it - http://datahub.io/docs/data-packages)

## CSV and JSON

For tabular data we auto generate CSV and JSON versions. Again, if we use "finance-vix" example here, we can find download links for CSV and JSON:
