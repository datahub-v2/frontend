Note that it is very heterogeneous among countries : in the United States \nof America, admin1 represents states, whereas they don't represent the inner countries in the United Kingdom. For more information, please see [official documentation][doc] \nor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_administrative_divisions_by_country.\n\nThe shape of the admin1 have four fields : \n* name : the common name for this admin1 subdivision\n* id : code for the subdivision inside the country. [Documentation][doc] is not clear what this code is, but it could be FIPS. Note that some countries like *Vatican* are so small they don't have inner administrative subdivision.
